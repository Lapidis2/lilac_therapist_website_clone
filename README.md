This repository contains my submission for **Stage 2: Practical Assignment** of the **Front-End Developer Internship** at **Grow My Therapy**.

##  Assignment Overview

The assignment was divided into four parts:

### **Part 1: Homepage Clone (UI Accuracy Test)**

### **Part 2: Creative Redesign (Theme, Copy & Images)**

After cloning, the homepage was redesigned using the fictional therapist profile:

**Dr. Maya Reynolds — Licensed Therapist**

All copy, images, and design decisions were strictly derived from the provided profile.

####  Redesign Highlights

- Introduced a **new cohesive color palette** (primary, secondary, accent)
- Replaced the original font with a more suitable typeface
- Updated all sections with:
  - SEO-optimized headings
  - Location-specific keywords
  - Profile-based services, bio, and FAQs
- Replaced all images with intentional visuals aligned with:
  - Therapy
  - Calm, trust, and professionalism
  - The new design theme

**Objective:** Evaluate design sense, copywriting clarity, and ability to translate a therapist’s profile into a conversion-focused homepage.

### **Part 3: Custom Section – “Our Office”**

A completely new section was added that does not exist in the original template.

#### Section Features:

- Describes the physical therapy office environment
- Uses details inferred directly from Dr. Maya Reynolds’ profile
- Includes:
  - Clear section heading
  - Warm, reassuring copy
  - 2–3 relevant office images
- Seamlessly integrated with the site’s existing layout, spacing, and theme

**Objective:** Test creativity, UX judgment, and real-world client thinking.

### **Part 4: Video Walkthrough (Communication Test)**

A **client-style Loom walkthrough** was recorded covering:

- Desktop and mobile views
- Design and color decisions
- How the therapist’s profile information was translated into copy
- Benefits explained in **non-technical language**, as if presenting to the client

**Objective:** Assess communication clarity, confidence, and client-facing explanation skills.
